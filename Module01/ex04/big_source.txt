A Day in the Life of a Developer:

8:00 AM: Wake up full of optimism. Today is the day! You’re going to conquer that bug that’s been haunting you for weeks. 
         You’re practically a wizard.

8:30 AM: Coffee acquired. IDE opened. Let’s do this. You stare at the code. The code stares back. Who will break first?

9:15 AM: Debugger says the variable is undefined. Your brain says, “How is that possible? I just defined it.” 
         Reality says, “Welcome to programming.”

10:00 AM: Stack Overflow tab count: 17. Confidence level: 3%. You copy-paste a solution. It doesn’t work.
        You start to question your life choices.

12:00 PM: Lunch break. You eat, but the bug eats away at your soul.

1:00 PM: Eureka! You fix the bug! Victory! The compiler runs smoothly. 
         The program works! For a fleeting moment, you feel like a genius.

1:01 PM: New error pops up. "Segmentation fault: core dumped." You Google it and realize that no one, in the history of programming,
         has ever understood what this means.

3:00 PM: Someone on your team says, “We should rewrite this in JavaScript.” Someone else says, “Let’s use AI for this!” 
        A heated debate ensues. Nobody wins.

4:30 PM: You decide to take a break. You scroll Twitter, where other programmers are sharing memes about bugs.
         You laugh through the pain.

5:45 PM: A junior developer asks, “Why is there a random +1 in this loop?” You respond, “I don’t know, it’s legacy code.” 
         You wrote it last week.

6:30 PM: You call it a day. The code isn’t perfect, but neither are you. You close your laptop and promise yourself you’ll deal with it tomorrow.

8:00 PM: In bed, staring at the ceiling, you realize: The problem wasn’t the code. The problem was the semicolon you forgot. Classic.
