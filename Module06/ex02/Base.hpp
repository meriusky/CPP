//REMEMBERðŸ’¡: POLYMORPHIC
//It literaly means "many forms" and it allows objects of different derived classes 
//to be treated as objects of the base class, but still retain their actual behavior.
//dynamic_cast is a C++ operator used with polymorphic types to safely convert a
//pointer or reference of a base class type into a derived class type.
